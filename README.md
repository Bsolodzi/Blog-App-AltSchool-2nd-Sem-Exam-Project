# Blogg-App-AltSchool-2nd-Sem-Exams
A blogging app created using python framework Flask and SQLAlchemy databases.

## To use the app:
1. Install Python if you do not have it.
2. Create a vitual environment.
3. Install flask and SQLAlchemy
4. Now, do "pip install -r requirements.txt" as all other tools and software needed to run the app is included in the text file. They will automatically be installed.

## Features of the Blog App
1. Allows users to create an account and login.
2. Logged in users are able to contribute to the blog by adding posts.
3. While all users whether authenticated or not can read all posts, users who are not the author of a post cannot make changes or delete the said blog. The author alone has that ability.
4. The blog has pages like: Home, About, and Contact which allows users to provide feedback to the software engineer(me).
5. Users are able to see both their posts and posts made by other users. 
6. Each post shows the title, author,content and the date and time at which the post was made and committed to the database.
7. UI is simple. Hence, very easy to navigate.

## Collaborations 
Though this project is my end of second semester exams project at AltSchool Africa, I will be constantly working on adding more features and also giving it a better UI.
I am looking forward to collaborating with frontend developers and also backend developers who would be interested to contribute.
